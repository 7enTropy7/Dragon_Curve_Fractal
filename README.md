# Dragon_Curve_Fractal

First of all, this code has been written in Python using the Turtle Package. In a nutshell, this is pretty similar to the good old PC Logo program. I’ve used simple loop structures to print this fractal.

How my Algorithm Works

We start off with 2 python lists called “new” and “old”. Both of them are character lists. The elements of “new” define the order in which our turtle will have to move in each iteration. On the other hand, “old” stores the movements of the previous iteration. I have also used a third list called “steps” which stores the movements across all the iterations combined. I created this list so that we can simply loop through all the elements of “steps” and move our turtle accordingly. Each of the elements in our lists can be ‘f’, ‘r’ or ‘l’ (which stand for forward, right and left respectively). Iterations of the Dragon curve can easily be generated by folding a strip of paper n number of times. Take a strip of paper and fold it in half to the right. Fold it in half again to the right. Just continue this process as many times as you want (of course it will be hard to fold after a certain point). Let’s say you do it 2 times.

Now unfold the strip and relax it, and you’ll notice that every bend/corner of the strip has become a 90-degree turn. What you have now is the second iteration of the Dragon Curve. If you fold the strip of paper in half for the third time and then open it up, you would get the third iteration and so on.
